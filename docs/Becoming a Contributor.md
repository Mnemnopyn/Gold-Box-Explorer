# Becoming a Contributor

Anyone can become a core contributor to the project. As a core contributor you'll have commit access to the source code repository and be able to be assigned issues and features.

In order to become a core contributor we would like you to have these attributes:

* The contributor has submitted at least one bug fix or feature enhancement patch in the past. 
* The contributor has shown good judgment. 
* The contributor shows a level commitment to the project. 

That's all it takes. Once you've comitted a patch or two feel free to contact one of the project co-ordinators to ask for access as a core contributor.
