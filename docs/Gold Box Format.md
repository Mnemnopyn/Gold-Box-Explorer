# Gold Box Format

Gold Box games were made up of many files, all of which were a custom format specifically for the game themselves. Over the years many people have been digging around, decrypting, and generally trying to figure out how these formats worked.

Gold Box Explorer is a viewing utility into these file formats. The first release only supports viewing images inside of DAX files but future releases will expose other parts of the DAX file format as well as allowing you to view and export other files from the game series.
